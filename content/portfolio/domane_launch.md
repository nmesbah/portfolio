With Trek-Segafredo rider Fabian Cancellara debouting Trek's completely redesigned Domane road bike at the Ronde van Vlaanderen, we created a media and retailer launch event the following day in nearby Kortrijk, BE to drive excitement around the cobblestone smoothing bike. In attendance was Fabian himself, who had raced the bike just a day earlier, along with the design and engineering team.

The morning after the product presentation and photo opportunity with Fabian, editors were invited to ride the new bike on the same cobblestone climbs and historic roads from the Tour of Flanders. Using motorcycle marshalls and professional photographers, media were treated to a well documented and uncompromised ride experience, and the positive media resulting from the event helped drive record sales.
