I am a creative event manager and designer who:

* Is originally from the birthplace of the coffee break.
* Currently based on the outskirts of what Christopher Reeve described as an &ldquo;industrial park in England &lbrack;with&rbrack; a dozen pigeons thrown in for atmosphere&rdquo;.
* Has hung collaborative gorilla public art from a viaduct.
* Likes riding bikes both short distances quickly and long distances slowly.
* Is known for a &ldquo;get shit done&rdquo; attitude.
* Co-hosted a late night college radio show.
* Doesn't have a British accent. I do infuse my jokes with bone dry sarcasm and a healthy dose of self-deprication and thus have been called &ldquo;not quite British, but surely more Canadian than American&rdquo;.
